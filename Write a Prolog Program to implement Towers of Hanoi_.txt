% move/4 predicate defines the main rule to solve the problem.
% move(N, Source, Destination, Auxiliary) moves N disks from Source to Destination using Auxiliary as temporary storage.

% Base case: Moving 0 disks doesn't require any moves.
move(0, _, _, _) :- !.

% Recursive case: 
% Move N-1 disks from Source to Auxiliary using Destination as temporary storage.
% Move the Nth disk from Source to Destination.
% Move the N-1 disks from Auxiliary to Destination using Source as temporary storage.
move(N, Source, Destination, Auxiliary) :-
    N > 0,
    M is N - 1,
    move(M, Source, Auxiliary, Destination),
    format('Move disk from ~w to ~w~n', [Source, Destination]),
    move(M, Auxiliary, Destination, Source).

% Example query to solve Towers of Hanoi with 3 disks.
% ?- move(3, left, right, center).
